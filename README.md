# scrapy_projects
 The folder contains all the scrapy spiders I have created as a part of the course on Udemy titled "Modern Web Scraping using Scrapy,Splash and Selenium"
 All these spiders are short and are oriented towards a simple task of extracting data and sometimes also handle pagination. Some of the spiders include a problem statement with them for reference purposes
